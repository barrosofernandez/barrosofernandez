- 👋 Hi, I’m @barrosofernandez
- 👀 I’m interested in Earth science, particularly volcano and environmental seismology. I have previous research experience in palaeomagnetism and hydrology. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub itself, statistics, German and French. And whatever my projects would need at any given time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to seismology. I'm open to work in any field!
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll think about it
- ⚡ Fun fact: my favourite animal is the iberian lynx.
