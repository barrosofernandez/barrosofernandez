- 👋 Hi, I’m @barrosofernandez
- 👀 I’m interested in Earth science, particularly volcano and environmental seismology. I have previous research experience in paleomagnetism and hydrology. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub itself, statistics, German and French. And whatever my projects would need at a time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to seismology. I'm open to work in any field, although I specialise in environmental seismology. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll think about it
- ⚡ Fun fact: my favorite animal is the iberian lynx.
